HTML basics: Food Recipes Website

The aim of this first project on the TOP curriculum is to put into practice the basic HTML elements that have been explained through out the first unit of the foundation course, as well as start familiarizing with git commands.

Goals:

- Understand and implement Git.
- Use the terminal commands to create new files and repositories.
- Create a basic HTML website using:
      -List
      -Links
      -Images
      -Headings
      -Paragraph

Thoughts:

The project itself represented a great opportunity to put in practice all the html elements I have learnt, but most important it has helped me understand how Git works.

And the very beginning I was quite lost on how it work, but definitely after working on this I can understand why is so useful.

I have personally found that the project was easy, I did felt quite confident and add a few extras.

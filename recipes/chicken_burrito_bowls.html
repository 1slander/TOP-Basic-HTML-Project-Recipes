    <ul>1 clove garlic, chopped</ul>
    <ul>640g cauliflower rice</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup low sodium chicken broth</ul>
    <ul>25g scallions, chopped</ul>
    <ul>4g cilantro, chopped</ul>
    <ul>15ml lime juice</ul>

    <ul>100g greek yogurt</ul>
    <ul>30g Chipotle in adobe sauce</ul>
    <ul>15ml lime juice</ul>
  </li>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<li>
  <ol>Heat one teaspoon of oil into a large non-stick saute pan.  Toss in garlic with a pinch of salt and saut√© until fragrant.
  </ol>
  <ol>Add cauliflower rice to the pan along with salt, pepper and chicken broth (or water).  Pop on the lid and cook for 3-4 minutes or until the rice is tender.</ol>
  <ol>Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool before stirring in scallions, cilantro and lime juice.  Set aside.</ol>
  <ol>Heat a large non-stick saute pan over a medium heat, add in remaining oil and ground chicken.  Season with salt and pepper and break into crumbles with a rubber or wooden spatula until the chicken is in crumbles.</ol>
  <ol>Once the chicken has turned from translucent to opaque, add in taco seasoning and stir to coat the chicken with the spices.  Cook for a couple more minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  Shut off the heat and allow to cool.</ol>
  <ol>Once all of your ingredients are prepped and ready to go, you are ready to assemble your bowls.</ol>
  <ol>Starting on one side of your meal prep container, layer cauliflower rice, corn, black beans, chicken and tomatoes.  Repeat until you make 4 burrito bowls.</ol>
  <ol>*OPTIONAL: combine greek yogurt, chipotle sauce and lime juice.  Mix well!  </ol>
  <ol>Store burrito bowls in the fridge for up to 5 days.  Top with yogurt sauce before eating.  Enjoy!</ol>
